# Dirac Delta as the Infinitesimal Primitive of Integral Transform

I've been thinking of the Dirac Delta function recently. At this point, it is old news that you can use it as the intitial basis for the heat equation and solve it. The idea is that only `normal` functions can be operated on in this capacity. That function is a very strange one and not something a mathematician would create. Yet it demonstrably provable that it useful, at the very least. That it needs more rigorous justification is a theoretical mathematician's chore; not a practical one.

It is not so much that the Dirac Delta function allows a solution for the heat equation that impresses me. It is that it's solution can serve as the heat kernel for the integral transform associated with the heat equation. There is something more primitive at work when solving with the Dirac Delta. It is as though the solution promulgates the base case of point-particle propagation. And because we know that the solutions to heat equations can be represented as a sum of point-particle propagations, we can use the Dirac Delta as the kernel for the integral transform. This is incredible to me.

Using transfinite induction, we can reliably justify how this point-particle interaction can lead to a more general form of heat solutions. Ultimately, the presence of the Laplace hints at the operational diffusion of heat propagating across some homogenous material. This is what we start with; solving for heat solutions with the minimal amounts of constraints and then we can build up to more complex solutions. We can even logically extend to non-homogenous materials.

The reason that the Dirac Delta function is appropriate in the context of heat propagation is because all solutions are sums of the laplacian taken at every point of the initial state. Every point will have some consequential operational artifact that represents being acted on by the Laplacian. Thus, the final solution for any initial state is the sum of all the point-particle propagations. You can see how Fourier transforms would be very appropriate in this context.

For a function with more than a single point, it is as if you are solving the Dirac Delta function for every point as the complete and comprehensive operation. Then, you sum back up the results to get the holistic solution.

Essentially that is what the heat kernel integral transform is doing when applied to an arbitrary function.
