# Polynomials as Complete

**Riddle me this**, Twitter math nerds.

Let's say you have some polynomial p(x) of degree n. We can be satisfied that applying calculus functions, integration and differentiation, will result in a polynomial. Specifically, taking the integral will result in the expression p(x)^{2}/2. I find this particularly interesting because it means that polynomials are closed under integration.
The reason this is interesting is because you can treat final expression of a polynomial as the abstract representation for any sort integration of a function. Thus, there are two interpretations of the expression p(x)^{2}/2. One is as the prima facie result of integrating a polynomial. The other is as the abstract representation of any sort of integration.

In the latter case, we have to be a bit rigorous about what we mean by "abstract representation" and interpret the square and the division as some sort of operation on the abstract symbols. We can symbolically capture what is happening in the indefinite integral by saying that the integral of p(x) is the expression p(x)^{2}/2. The raw semantic sentence would evaluate to something like "the integral of p(x) is the expression p(x)^{2}/2, where the result computing the integral leads to us squaring and then dividing by 2".
So something about integration leads us to assume that the number two, in the flavor of square and division, is sufficient for capturing the abstract representation of integration.

It is not so much that there is something special about polynomials; they're just the favorite of mathematicians everywhere. It is not an overstatement to say that mathematicians think in polynomials.
Notice that I didn't finish my thought on abstract representation. If were to find us a new functional domain, we would know from the nature of integration that the integral of a function in that domain would be captured by the expression p(x)^{2}/2. The only difficulty is rigorously defining the operation of squaring and dividing by two in exotic domains.
